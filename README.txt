This repository contains code to explore the Salaries dataset in R.

The Salaries dataset in R can be found in the carData package. The data was collected from a college in the U.S. and contains information on the 2008-2009 nine-month academic salaries of Assistant Professors, Associate Professors, and Professors.


Specifically, my analysis aimed to:

1. Assess descriptive statistics and variable distributions in the dataset

2. Perform regression analysis to see what factors predict nine-month salary for a faculty member
